# Inheritance
Inheritance is the action of basing the implementation of a class/object off another class/object.
An object created through inheritance retains the properties and behaviours of its parent.

This feature is very useful for extending existing software and implementations with new features
and behaviours while keeping much of the existing properties, as well as maximising the reuse of
code.

A class that inherits the properties of another class is called a **subclass**.
