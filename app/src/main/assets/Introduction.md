# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
There are multiple ways to write programs for computers, known as programming paradigms. One of the
most popular programming paradigms is *Object Oriented Programming (OOP)*. OOP is a programming
paradigm centred around objects, which are used to interact with each other.

Popular object-oriented programming languages include Java, C++, Python, JavaScript and Ruby.

## What is an Object?
An object is a collection of information and code, often used to represent real life items and
phenomena. The advantage of using objects in programming is that they allow business processes
to be more easily represented and implemented in code, due to their mapping and representation with
real life objects.

## Characteristics of Objects
Objects usually contain the following characteristics, and are defined in the class:
* Fields (or attributes) - data containing information about the object
* Procedures (or methods) - computer instructions defining some actions, usually (but not always)
  concerned with the object's fields.

## Features of OOP
OOP is characterised by the following features, which will be covered in later modules:
* Abstraction - The concept of hiding the details of an object's implementation from its users
* Polymorphism - The ability to call code that is agnostic to whether it is from the object's parent
  or descendants
* Inheritance - The ability for an object to take and build upon the properties of another class
* Encapsulation - The concept of hiding and controlling access to an object's data and code
