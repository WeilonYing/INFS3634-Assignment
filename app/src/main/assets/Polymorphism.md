# Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the use of a single interface or symbol to represent multiple different types.
It can be done through the provision of a single **interface** as a set of common methods and data fields).
Alternatively, polymorphism can also be done through **subtyping**, where instances of multiple
classes are treated as a single common superclass (parent class).
