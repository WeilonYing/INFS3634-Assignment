# OOPBuddy (INFS3634-Assignment)
Assignment project for INFS3634 (Mobile Application Development) at the University of New South Wales.
OOPBuddy is an Android app made by Weilon Ying for the INFS3634 course assignment in 2018 (S2).

It features the implementation of features requested in the assignment specification, including:
* Provision of learning material from one of the courses in the School of Information Systems. In
this app, learning material for Object Oriented Programming from INFS1609 is provided.
* A form of assessing the user's knowledge of the course material. The app provides a multiple choice
quiz to test the user's knowledge on specific topics in OOP, with feedback on the user's progress
at the conclusion of the quiz.
* Use of an external API. OOPBuddy uses the MarkdownView API, GSON, the Google Cloud Translate API,
Material UI and the YouTube Player API to implement extra features in the app.

Extra features include:
* Simple course material extensibility. Extra learning material can be written for users with
Markdown, while quizzes are defined using JSON. No extra programming is required.
* YouTube video supplements. Users can supplement their learning with YouTube videos that can be
directly accessed within the app in each lesson.
* Auto-translated lessons. Each chapter can be translated into another language using the Google
Cloud Translate API.
